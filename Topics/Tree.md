# Tree
**Timeline (Feb. 24 - )**
1. How to traverse the tree? There are two general strategies to traverse a tree:
  * **Depth First Search (DFS)**
    * In this strategy, we adopt the **depth** as the priority, so that one would start from a root and reach all the way down to certain leaf, and then back to root to reach another branch. The DFS strategy can further be distinguished as **preorder**, **inorder**, and **postorder** depending on the relative order among the root node, left node and right node.
  * **Breadth First Search (BFS)**
    * We scan through the tree level by level, following the order of height, from top to bottom. The nodes on higher level would be visited before the ones with lower levels.

2. [Master Theorem](../resources/master_theorem.pdf) for calculating the time complexity for recursion problems.

3. A [node](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Node_(computer_science)) is a structure which may contain a value or condition, or represent a separate data structure (which could be a tree of its own). Each node in a tree has zero or more **child nodes**, which are below it in the tree (by convention, trees are drawn growing downwards). A node that has a child is called the child's **parent node** (or superior). A node has at most one parent, but possibly many ancestor nodes, such as the parent's parent. Child nodes with the same parent are **sibling nodes**.
    * An **internal node** (also known as an **inner node**, **inode** for short, or **branch node**) is any node of a tree that has child nodes. Similarly, an **external node** (also known as an **outer node**, **leaf node**, or **terminal node**) is any node that does not have child nodes.
    * The **depth** of a node is the length of the path to its root (i.e., its root path). This is commonly needed in the manipulation of the various self-balancing trees, [AVL Trees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree) in particular. 
      * The root node has depth 0. 
    * The **height** of a node is the length of the longest downward path to a leaf from that node, or equivalently, the depth of its deepest node. The height of the root is the height of the tree. 
      * Leaf nodes have height 0.
    * A tree with only a single node (hence both a root and leaf) has depth and height zero. Conventionally, an empty tree (tree with no nodes, if such are allowed) has height and depth âˆ’1.

4. Some problems I didn't come up with a good idea when I first try to solve them. Maybe worth revisiting:
  * **Easy**: [L1022](https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-root-to-leaf-binary-numbers/), [L235](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-search-tree/) (In BST, the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of given input `p` and `q` is the split node which has the property: `p.val <= node.val <= q.val` or `q.val <= node.val <= p.val`)
  * **Medium**: [L236](https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-a-binary-tree/solution/)
